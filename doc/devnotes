Moss Fighter 2016

Simple modular music, adapts to gameplay

Different data stucture for storing entities

Different AI that adapt to state of player, environment (ideas from Chris:  behaving differently in groups, different player health, different monster health, run away vs. attack, attack slowly)

Incorporate stealth (from games like Assasin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Skyrim); monsters won't react if you move very slowly around them.  Problem:  representing which direction they're facing?
Also, certain terrains could be harder to move around in.
Multiple-symbol entities:  multiple entities sharing state, moving in unison?

Some vehicle you can find, mount, and travel twice as fast (but obviously easier to run into things, harder to turn)
