MossFighter 2016

Make your way to the final moss in the revolutionary new Roguelike game, MossFighter 2016!  Play as Moss Def, a short-tempered computer science student and hip-hop mossician who one days wakes up to find himself in the midst of a hell beyond his wildest nightmares, a brightly-lit outdoor space thats entirely filled with various levels and forms of hostile moss.  These leafy greens are out to get you, and you must make the mosst of your situation.  Enjoy a stunning 100% moss-less audio soundtrack as you explore the almost pleasantly mossy terrain and fight the most heinous moss-ters in the universe.

Inspirations:  Chris Warren's demo Roguelike game.  All RPGs, Roguelikes, hack-n-slashes that have inanimate dummy enemies you can battle...I've seen fish, plants and trees, crates, small insects, pots, worms, and various household appliances and objects.
